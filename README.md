# Julia

Julia is a high-level, general-purpose dynamic programming language. Its features are well suited for numerical analysis and computational science. One of the main aims of Julia's inception was to create a language that enables programmers to write code that is clear, high-level, generic, and abstract code resembling mathematical formulas while still being able to produce fast, low-level machine code usually seen in static languages.
